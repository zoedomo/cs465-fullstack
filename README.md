CS-465 Full Stack Development with MEAN

# FINAL PROJECT IS ON MODULE7 BRANCH

**Architecture**

In our full stack project, we used different frontend development approaches, including Express HTML for server-side rendering and Angular for building a single-page application (SPA). Express HTML was used for rendering dynamic content on the server-side, while Angular provided a more interactive user experience on the client-side. The difference is in the traditional approach of server-side rendering with Express HTML versus the modern approach of client-side rendering with Angular. The backend utilized a NoSQL MongoDB database due to its flexibility and scalability. NoSQL databases are suitable for handling unstructured data, making them ideal for web applications where data formats may differ.

**Functionality**

JSON is a lightweight data interchange format inspired by JavaScript object syntax, but it is distinct from JavaScript itself. JSON serves as a common data format that ties together the front-end and back-end development pieces by facilitating the exchange of data between them. During the full stack development process, we refactored code to improve functionality and efficiency, particularly by creating reusable UI components. These reusable components helped development, reduced duplication of code, and improved maintainability. For example, the navigation bar or trip card display, which could then be reused across different parts of the application.

**Testing**

Testing in a full stack application involves various methods for request and retrieval, API testing of endpoints, and considerations for security layers. Methods such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE are used to interact with API endpoints, which serve as interfaces for communication between front-end and back-end components. API testing ensures that these endpoints function correctly and handle requests appropriately. Testing can become more complex when additional security layers, such as authentication and authorization, are added. Understanding methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application involves not only verifying that endpoints return the expected responses but also handling errors and making sure secure data transmission and access.

**Reflection**

This course has been helpful in allowing me to reach my professional goals by providing a complete understanding of full stack development and equipping me with practical skills that are highly wanted in the industry. Throughout the course, I have learned, developed, and mastered various skills, including front-end and back-end development, database management, API design, and testing methodologies. These skills have made me a more marketable candidate in my career by allowing me to work through complex projects.
